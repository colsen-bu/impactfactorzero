excerpt: Testing the new automatic deployment system with just markdown!
---

This post demonstrates the new simplified workflow! I'm writing this as a simple markdown file, and when I push to GitHub, it will automatically:

## What Happens Automatically

1. **Convert** this markdown to beautiful HTML
2. **Generate** a table of contents from these headers
3. **Update** the homepage with this post
4. **Deploy** everything to GitHub Pages

## Markdown Features

Let me test some markdown features:

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from auto-deployed blog!")
    return "ðŸŽ‰"
```

### Lists and Formatting

- **Bold text** works great
- *Italic text* also works
- `Inline code` is supported
- [Links work too](https://github.com)

### Footnotes

This blog supports footnotes[^1] which are super useful for academic writing[^academic].

### Tables

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Auto-deploy | âœ… |
| Table of contents | âœ… |
| Footnotes | âœ… |
| Rich formatting | âœ… |

## The Beauty of Simplicity

No more Python scripts to run! Just:

1. Write markdown
2. Push to GitHub  
3. Blog is updated automatically

This makes blogging so much simpler and more enjoyable. You can focus on writing instead of managing build processes.

## Conclusion

If you can see this post on the live blog, then the automatic deployment is working perfectly! ðŸš€

[^1]: Footnotes automatically get converted to clickable links with proper styling.

[^academic]: Perfect for citations and additional context without cluttering the main text.
